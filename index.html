                <p class="mb-5 col-5">
Lexicography is currently embracing rapid change as the traditional methods of publishing dictionaries are replaced by the ubiquity of lexical information on the Web. Furthermore, the application of computational techniques to the process of lexicography are revolutionizing how dictionaries can be constructed. In this context, the recently started ELEXIS project aims to develop a new infrastructure for electronic lexicography across Europe, that builds a virtuous cycle of lexicography where lexicographic resources are linked across languages, in order to build improved natural language processing tools, which can then aid in the construction of novel resources and retro-digitization of dictionaries, thus driving the cycle. The project is naturally multilingual covering 15 European countries and has a strong interest in driving lexicography for under-resourced and minoritized languages.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-5 col-5">
The workshop has three main aims, firstly we will invite speakers from existing major lexicographic efforts to provide summaries of the work at the cutting edge of lexicography. We will invite speakers who are part of major dictionary efforts and have already approached Oxford English Dictionaries regarding this. Secondly, we will provide a tutorial and hands-on with the ELEXIS infrastructure to enable participants to become familiar with the technologies being developed in the project. Finally, we will make an open call for posters, which will provide an overview of new projects in the area of electronic lexicography.
